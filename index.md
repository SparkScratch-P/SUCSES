SUCSES is an **opensource encode-decode engine kit**, entirely made on scratch made by SparkScratch_P. It has been made
in 3 different versions; 16, 32 and 64 respectively, each capable of different activities, namely encyption of text, list and images.

## SUCSES 16:

<a id="forkme_banner" href="https://github.com/SparkScratch-P/SUCSES/raw/main/sucses%2016.sb3">Download SB3</a>

The **text** Encoding and decoding engine for scratch.

It is - 

 - Capable of decoding 91 chars.
 - Case sensitive
 - Super simple and fast
 - Transformed from a 65 char encoder of Suhalo_351
 - on scratcth to 91 char by SparkScratch_P

## SUCSES 32:

<a id="forkme_banner" href="https://github.com/SparkScratch-P/SUCSES/raw/main/sucses%2032.sb3">Download SB3</a>

The **List** encode-decode engine for Scratch. The SUCSES 16 Engine has been enhanced 
to this list coding engine, with a 
very simple and easy algorith.
 
As of March 2021, this is the simplest and most 
supported cloud list engine, ever made on scratch and 
the first  cloud list engine in India


 - 89 Chars Supported! (including cases)
 - Case sensitive
 - Can encode an item of length 100 in 0.1 sec
 - Simple Algo (The simplest existing, as of 2021)
 - Super fast and smooth ; never will it hang!
 - Supported in all versions from Scratch 2.0
 - Supported in JS when converted 

## SUCSES 64:

It is the **Image Encode-Decode** system of SECSES code series.
It is not available as a snippet engine, rather , it requires 3 scratch sprites, namely [encode.sprite3](https://github.com/SparkScratch-P/SUCSES/blob/main/README.md#encodesprite3) , [decode.sprite3](https://github.com/SparkScratch-P/SUCSES/blob/main/README.md#decodesprite3) and [pen.sprite3](https://github.com/SparkScratch-P/SUCSES/blob/main/README.md#pensprite3)

Before describing the 3 sprites in detail, let's read about one important thing!

### The Archiebuild

[Use Archiebuild online](https://sparkscratch-p.github.io/ArchieBuild/)

**Archiebuild** is a MSW LOGO-like programming software, coded on scratch, published as JS. This software is able to program
 a pen such that the pen will draw a figure as coded. Here the movements of the pen r coded, and the code is saved in a
list named `CODE:\_` . On saving, it encodes the list and copied to clipboard. This Save code is actually the SUCSES 64 code.
The ArchieBuild ans well as the ***SUCSES 64 reader*** is capable of encoding and decoding or program and running it.

The sprites r avaiable in these sb3 files, however, to use it to draw new things, *the whole database of Archiebuild needs to be induced.*
To read and execute the data, *the whole database of SUCSES 64 reader needs to be induced in the same.*

***NOTE*** that both SUCSES and Archiebuild r opensourced . Archiebuild and it's reader is available for
use in any browser from 'Sparkscratch-p.github.io' and as'Windows Executable file' in App-ocalypse Appbox.

#### encode.sprite3

[Download the sprite](https://github.com/SparkScratch-P/SUCSES/raw/main/encoder.sprite3)

It has total arrangements to encode the "CODE:\_" list and save to clipboard.

#### decode.sprite3

[Download the sprite](https://github.com/SparkScratch-P/SUCSES/raw/main/decoder.sprite3)

It can decode the whole of SUCSES 64 code in the list usable by pen.sprite3

#### Pen.sprite3

[Download the sprite](https://github.com/SparkScratch-P/SUCSES/raw/main/Pen.sprite3)

It can execute and thus, draw the diagram programmed in the SUCses 64 code.
